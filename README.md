# Letter of Credit Demo

This is a CorDapp that uses a letter-of-credit business scenario to showcase Corda.

## Running the nodes:

* Create the node driver by running `./gradlew buildExecutableJar` (osX) or `gradlew buildExecutableJar` (Windows)
* Run the node driver using `java -Xmx8192m -jar kotlin-source/build/libs/eloc-demo.jar`

## Interacting with the nodes:

Once all the nodes are started, go to `localhost:10007`

## Update process (development only)

### Updating the web frontend

If the [front-end](https://github.com/corda/LetterOfCreditWeb) has been modified, it needs to be redeployed onto the nodes. You do this by

* Run `npm install` in the root folder of the [front-end](https://github.com/corda/LetterOfCreditWeb) project
* Building the [front-end](https://github.com/corda/LetterOfCreditWeb) project by running `ng build --prod --aot --build-optimizer --base-href="/web/loc/"` from the root of the project
* Navigate to the newly created 'dist' folder within the root of the [front-end](https://github.com/corda/LetterOfCreditWeb) project
* Copy the entire contents of the 'dist' folder into the CorDapp project at 'LetterOfCredit\kotlin-source\src\main\resources\loc'
* Redeploy CorDapp as above
