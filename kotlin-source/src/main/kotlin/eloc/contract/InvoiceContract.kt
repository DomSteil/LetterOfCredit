/**
 * An invoice is a document that describes a trade between a buyer and a buyer. It is issued on a particular date,
 * it lists goods being sold by the buyer, the cost of each good and the total amount owed by the buyer and when
 * the buyer expects to be paid by.
 *
 * In the trade finance world, invoices are used to create other contracts (for example AccountsReceivable), newly
 * created invoices start off with a status of "unassigned", once they're used to create other contracts the status
 * is changed to "assigned". This ensures that an invoice is used only once when creating a financial product like
 * AccountsReceivable.
